Steps to execute script:

1. Run setup file first
       	 cd scrub_mirror
	 $setup.ksh Primary_physical_device Secondary_physical_device

    Imp Note :
    In setup.ksh instead of using side primary and side secondary partition      of disk Mirror primary and Mirror Secondary.
    we using Mirror primary and Mirror secondary as it is /dev/sda(device1) /dev/sdb(device2)
    Partition done in methods
    set_partition ${SIDE_PRIMARY##*s} "" $MIRROR_SIZE $MIRROR_PRIMARY
    set_partition ${SIDE_SECONDARY##*s} "" $MIRROR_SIZE $MIRROR_SECONDARY
    currently script will run withaout partitioning part.
    So additional part need to be update.
